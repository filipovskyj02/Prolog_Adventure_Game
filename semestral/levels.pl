  "Level 0 is a confusing and unsettling place where all the rooms are 
  similar but not identical. 
  They all have yellowed wallpaper, damp carpet, and flickering
  fluorescent lighting. The lighting makes a loud and constant humming noise,
  and it's not clear what is causing it. There is also a strange
  substance on the carpet that cannot be identified and is not safe to consume.").

 "A large warehouse space with concrete floors and walls, exposed rebar,
  and a low-hanging fog that can condense into puddles on the floor. It has
  a consistent supply of water and electricity,
  and is more expansive than Level 0, with staircases, elevators, 
  isolated rooms, and hallways. Random crates with a variety of supplies
  and objects appear and disappear in the Level, and should be approached with caution.
  These crates can contain vital items like food, water, batteries, and medical supplies,
  as well as more unusual objects like car parts, crayons, and partially burned paper.
  It is important to take precautions when living in this Level, as it is not clear what dangers may be present.").

 "Level 2 consists mainly of dark, grey, concrete maintenance tunnels that stretch
  on for millions of miles. The walls are lined with pipes and ventilation ducts, 
  which often contain a thick viscous black liquid. Doors can sometimes be found, 
  but most are locked or lead to dead ends. These rooms typically house shelves with random assortments of
  objects, occasionally computers. In certain parts of the tunnels, the heat can become unbearable, 
  reaching 43°C (110°F) or higher. This is usually in areas where the machinery is the loudest, 
  typically at the ends of hallways. The Entities found on this Level are some of the most 
  dangerous in The Backrooms. Noises can be heard from the vents, which are 
  caused by Crawlers. You can also find Mark in employee bathrooms on Level 2. 
  Other beings here include Smilers, Child Facelings, Clumps, Hounds, Male Deathmoths,
  Wretches, Plague Goblins, Bursters, and Skin-Stealers. The only thing you need to know is to run away the moment you see one.").

 "Level 3 is a series of long, dark, twisting hallways that work similarly to Level 0.
  They all consist of randomly segmented rooms, which form in no particular pattern, 
  and are extremely loud with the noises of machinery. The hallways are very narrow 
  and enclosed, some even requiring wanderers of average height and build to bend, 
  hunch, crawl, or walk sideways through them. The walls are comprised of dusty, 
  brown bricks, usually covered in segments of copper pipes and mechanical components.
  The floors are made of an even dustier grey-tiled floor, whilst the ceiling
  is made entirely from metal. Level 3 is one of the larger levels of the Backrooms,
  estimated at around 350 million square miles in area (~563 million square kilometers).
  This makes sightings of fellow wanderers scarce when traveling through Level 3. 
  It is recommended that you enter Level 3 only if you are properly prepared to defend yourself
  from anything lurking in the hallways with you,
  as it is highly unlikely that any aid will come to you should you need it.").

  "Level 4 resembles an empty office building, though it is almost completely devoid of furniture.
  Some rooms on this level have windows, though most of them have been completely blacked out.
  Any windows that have not been blacked out are considered traps and should be avoided at all costs.
  Level 4 is mostly devoid of entities. Hounds and Dullers are the only ones to have been observed. 
  One person claimed they saw a Smiler, but no evidence exists. Because of this lack of beings, 
  there are lots of people on Level 4. Scattered around this level, water coolers, vending machines,
  and fountains containing Almond Water can be found. Level 4 is very easy to escape from (and also return to).").

  "Level 5 is an infinite hotel complex, with many rooms and halls. The Level itself seems to have been constructed in the 1930s,
  with furniture dating back to 1920. There are three main areas in Level 5 that are fully accessible.
  The surroundings of Level 5 are littered with decorations and furniture from the early 20th century, 
  with the main hall being the most object-populated area. The Level is mostly clean with little dust and dirt lingering on surfaces,
  and it seems to clean itself as unclean spots disappear a few minutes after they are made. 
  The pristine floors and well-cared areas make Level 5 unsettling, especially compared to other nearby levels.
  Smooth jazz plays quietly throughout the halls via vintage turntables and speakers hooked up to a sound system. 
  The choice and switching of music seem to be random and out of place. Level 5 is infamous for its strange noises, 
  such as distant party chatter that can be heard on the other side of walls. 
  People have reported an unseen presence watching them around every corner, as well as whispering noises 
  and something tapping their shoulder when they are alone. There are also reports of watching eyes from the aged paintings scattered about.").

  "Very little is known about the actual structure of Level 6, as the level is shrouded in total and complete darkness.
  No light permeates the level, and light sources brought into the level have no function.
  Navigation of Level 6 is carried out by feeling one's way through the darkness, 
  which has revealed that the level is comprised of a seemingly endless series of tight hallways made of a smooth,
  cold material (likely concrete). In addition to being permanently dark, Level 6 is also eerily silent, 
  akin to a soundproof room. To explore Level 6 is to subject oneself to a slow journey through complete darkness, 
  total silence, and utter isolation. As such, most people who have spent more than a few minutes in Level 6
  have reported feelings of paranoia, dread, anxiety, and rising tension due to the unknowable nature of what may lie 
  in the darkness around them. Several witnesses have also reported occasional auditory hallucinations,
  such as scuttling sounds, breathing, or whispering. Those who have spent extended time in Level 6 recall
  feeling as though they were the only ones unable to see. Level 6 is largely regarded as one of the most 
  dangerous early levels in the Backrooms. However, investigations have shown that as of now, 
  no entities have been found on this level. Despite this, few people seem to leave Level 6. The reason for this is unknown.").

  "Level 7 is an impossibly large ocean that seems to stretch infinitely in all directions.
  Despite the absence of fixed light sources within the level, a dim natural light is present across the level.
  Detailed exploration of this ocean is sparse due to the extreme danger and the amount
  of preparation it requires to navigate. Level 7 is composed of two rooms:
  the entrance room and the room containing the ocean itself, with a high concrete ceiling suspended above the water.
  The entrance room is the most wearable point in the level and should be used as a home base for those who dare to explore the ocean.
  The entrance room is fully furnished and has a different centre of gravity than the rest of the level.
  The vast majority of Level 7 is composed of the ocean outside of the entrance,
  which is mostly uncharted and appears to be almost completely devoid of life.
  Wanderers have discovered uninhabited islands made of an unknown rock scattered across the surface of the water.").

beginDesc("As you opened your eyes, you found yourself disoriented and confused.
 You couldn't remember how you had gotten there or where you were. 
 You tried to sit up, but instead of a bed, you found yourself sprawled on the damp carpet. 
 You looked around and saw that you were in a small, cramped room with yellowed walls 
 and flickering fluorescent lighting. The atmosphere was oppressive and unsettling. 
 The constant humming of the lights and the strange substance on the carpet only added
  to your sense of unease.
You slowly got to your feet, trying to take stock of the situation.
 No matter which way you turned, the rooms all looked the same. 
 It was like you were trapped in some kind of never-ending maze").
